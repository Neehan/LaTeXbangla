This package simplifies the process of writing Bangla in L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X and addresses the associated typesetting issues. With L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>Xbangla, you can just type usual L<sup>A</sup>T<sub>E</sub>X syntax and expect everything to work as it should. 

Notable features:
-----------------
- Automatic transition from Bangla to English (and vice versa).
- Patch for the unproportionate whitespace issue in popular Bangla fonts.
- Full support for all the common commands and environments.
- Bangla numbering for every counter. (extending polyglossia's support).
- New theorem, problems, example, solution and other environments in Bangla.
